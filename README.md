#3D Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to Andrew's 6.115 final project github folder!

For my final project, I built a 3D Tic Tac Toe game, complete with an AI for the user to play against. The input of the game used capacitave based sensing chips, and the output of the game was displayed on a VGA screen. I used my 8051 and R31JP to connect with my PSoC to process the user input and game engine.
